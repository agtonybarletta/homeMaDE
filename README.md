# Personal Rice - Desktop Environment

Collection of scripts to install all programs and configuratios for my  xfce4+awesomeWm setup

## Requirements

~Debian~ Arch linux must be already installed before running this scripts.
A clean installation with `archinstall` should do the work.

## Desktop environment

- Distribution: Arch linux

- Windows Manager: AwesomeWM
- Terminal: Konsole

## Run

```bash
./install.sh
```

## TODO
- [ ] use script.sh template on install_basic.sh
- [ ] use script.sh template on install_de_config.sh
- [X] use script.sh template on install_directories.sh
- [X] look for autocompletion feature on bash read command (for install_directories.sh)
- [X] make install_directories.sh interactive
- [ ] dive into awesome theming (color scheme)
- [ ] write script to compile sass Awaita theme using custom color scheme
- [ ] Make this configuration multi distro (arch & debian)
